I need a data structure with resistance:

processing sensory input
x    the perceptron festoons sensory input with archetypal attributes to create a sestrumen

x    the ei takes that decorated input (sestrumen) and creates or recalls a rhema if it cares

x    the ci creates or recalls rhemas of the leftovers

    position ideas in memory

cogitation
    the ci processes first order ideas into higher order ideas to its abilities

agitation
    the ei tries to marshall similar rhemas with excited sub-threshold rhemas to trigger a response

creation
    the ci loads ideas onto the processors, the processor loads similar ideas to build a charge to connect to other processors
    the resistance to connection is the distance btw the ideas, sum of similarity reduces that distance

ideas have to have a physical location that is incremented from the last most similar by fractal branching algorithm

first order ideas
    experience sensation
    ei judge
    ei recognize
    ci recognize
    ci synthesize idea by analogy
    position idea

higher order ideas
    compose 2+ ideas
        blend evaluation, history, attributes
        keep roots

similarity is from the attributes
    attributes should be a finite but extendable list (extendable by composition)

coordinate system is pro anti non
    0-5 scale gives us 125 boxes
    need a map of box contents
    if more than one in the box, branch off the most similar
